6>What is routing in Express?
7>How do you handle 404 errors in Express?
    --->
    In Express, you handle 404 errors by adding a catch-all middleware that runs after all your routes. If no route matches, this middleware sends a 404 response.
    app.use((req, res) => {
    res.status(404).send('404 Not Found');
    });

8> What is app.use()?
    ----> 
    In Express, app.use() is used to register middleware—functions that run during the request–response lifecycle.

9>What is body-parser? Is it still required?
10> How do you serve static files in Express?
    ---> 
    In Express, you serve static files using the built-in middleware express.static().

    import express from 'express';
    const app = express();
    app.use(express.static('public'));
    app.listen(3000);

13> How do you handle errors in Express?
    ------>
    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
        console.error(err.stack); // log error
        res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
    });

14> How do you validate request data?
15> How do you secure an Express API?
    ------->
    Use HTTPS – Encrypts data in transit to prevent eavesdropping.

    Authentication – Verify the user’s identity using JWT, OAuth, or API keys.

    Authorization – Control what authenticated users can access based on roles/permissions.

    Input validation & sanitization – Prevent injections and malicious input from clients.

    Secure HTTP headers – Use helmet to set headers like X-Frame-Options and Strict-Transport-Security.

    Rate limiting / throttling – Limit requests per IP to prevent brute-force and DoS attacks.

    CORS configuration – Restrict which domains can access your API.

    Hide sensitive errors – Don’t expose stack traces or internal information in production.

    Secure cookies & sessions – Use httpOnly, secure, and sameSite flags.

    Logging & monitoring – Track suspicious activity and failed requests.

    Keep dependencies updated – Avoid vulnerabilities by running npm audit and updating packages.

    Advanced protections (optional) – CSRF tokens, CSP headers, IP whitelisting for critical routes.
